Starting about with the big boys are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/
">New Vegas Nexus</a></a>
 (add links) and <a href="https://gunetwork.org
">Gunetwork</a></a>
 and mod games not going to do a big description for these 3 as you could just go to fallout 3 section and see my long description so I will just be posting the ones that I know are exclusively new Vegas and or I forgot to put them in the fallout 3 section of it

This page contains a <a href="https://vk.com/masseffectevolution
">huge mass effect mod</a></a> 20+ gb that overhauls the game be warned I'm pretty sure this replace texture and models so Make a backup before this and for steam copy don't have syncing so you can restore to completely vannila incase something goes wrong

This is a site called<a href="http://falcon-lair.com/files/category/2-fallout-new-vegas/
">falcon lair</a></a> it is in Russian so many people who posted there stuff on the unique stuff is slightly easier to find as there is less reposts of mods but they are still there.

<p>
This is one of the the big boys its called <a href="https://www.moddb.com/games/fallout-new-vegas"
">moddb</a></a> it has a lot of mods for half-life 1 and 2 thats how it got its popularity. it has a lot less mods than for example nexus and gunetwork for the fallout games but its a great place to see progress on the upcoming new California mod and the frontier.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/"
">Tale Of Two Wastelands</a></a> is an amazing mod made by a group of talented modders that have added the capital wasteland from fallout 3 into Fallout New Vegas, story and everything into the updated engine of fallout new Vegas there is also other mods contained on this site beside this great beast of a mod
