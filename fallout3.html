<p> hey this is  where I will be posting and linking to mods on websites and places you for fallout 3  <p>

<p>
Well the most well known one is  <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/
">Nexus mods</a></a> I post a majority of mods on nexus myself pretty nice community and thousands upon thousands of mods there to visit most well known modding site beside steam workshop  
</p>
<p>
There is really no competitor with nexus but <a href="https://www.gunetwork.org
">Gunetwork</a></a> has its own sizable they usually make mods which nexus mods don't allow model ports. Model ports are when you take a model from example csgo and put the model in the game. the reason it is not allowed in a lot of other communitys is because a many people shun it because your basically stealing another persons hard work, I personally believe that its fine because in order to port a majority of things in the first place it takes a lot of hard work to even port them in the first place sometimes even longer than making your own
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.weltvolk.de/index.php?link=computerspiele
"
">Weltvok</a></a> is a website with almost exclusively dead space mods and Skyrim mods not very much and I think its a German website a good way to find sites such as these is on youtube.com
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://modgames.net"
">mod games</a></a> is the most popular Russian modding site there is to my knowledge.
This site is Russian so expect almost all the mods to be in the Russian so you might have to edit them in the geck if your bothered by that. As there are no rules on porting there are models from other games on here just like gunetwork, this site also allows reposts in the form of translation so many mods you think are new are actually repost but search through there and you will find some hidden gems. 
</p>

<p>
now is the time for the mediafire links as I don't play fallout 3 personally theres going to be less links in this section. <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/folder/l6yluk45l1lmt/losts_mods"
">media fire</a></a> Starting with my folder it mostly contains new Vegas and 4 mods but there are 1 or 2 fallout 3 mods. Now this folder is a older version of a member on guns private folder lots of interesting things and maybe a faction overhaul <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/1z2uabx5sz37n/Corehound&#39;s_VGU_Cloud_v3"
">corehounds mediafire</a></a>. 
Now this is a persons named <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/26bbktdz961n8/Mods_for_v"
">bunsaki's private mediafire</a></a> many thing might be missing that they were previously as it seems he's deleting them. Now this is <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/folder/m1j5gkat1vtjl/Games"
">4chan vg's board media fire</a></a> got some interesting mods some weird ones but interesting. 
<p>
This is a work and progress <a href="https://vk.com/adgames"
">fallout 3 mod that combines the world of fallout and stalker</a></a> that is still being worked on to this day bringing the land of Chernobyl and Pripyat to the the fallout 3 engine this mod has lots of progress as its has been being worked on for 5+ years so there is a lot of things to do in the remade world of Chernobyl
</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.fileplanet.com/107299/0/section/Fallout-3"
">fileplanet</a></a> applies to both new Vegas and fallout 3 it has some of the mods that were removed early on in the new Vegas and fallout 3
